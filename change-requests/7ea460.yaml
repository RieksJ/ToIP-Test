            An Actor is someone or something that can actually do things, such
            as people or machines. Actors will generally do things, i.e. execute
            actions in different ways, depending on the context, or the party
            for whom they do this.

          an actor that is executing an action action on behalf of some party
          (which we call the principal of that agent).
        notes:
          - >-
            During the time interval in which the action is executed, the actor
            may execute other actions in other execution-contexts, on behalf of
            the same or another party. However, for the execution of a single
            action, the actor is an agent for precisely one principal. It is
            assumed that the principal provides its agents with the policies
            that provide the agents with the rules, working-instructions,
            preferences and other guidance that they need to comply with when
            exeucting the action.
